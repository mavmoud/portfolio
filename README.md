# My Portfolio Website

This portfolio project is a comprehensive showcase of my work,
skills, and experience. Designed in Figma and built using React and TypeScript, the website serves
as a dynamic introduction to who I am as a developer. It features sections for my projects,
education, professional experience, and technical expertise.
